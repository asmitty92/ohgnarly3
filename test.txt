Well, I'm honest to a fault most of the time. I tend to let the things in my head come out without much thought or sugar-coating. I read a lot. I love to walk my neighborhood at nights when the weather is warm enough. I love Trivial Pursuit. I majored in Liberal Studies in college so that I could educate myself the way I wanted rather than simply prep for a career. I love to laugh. I like to watch comedy movies and tv shows. I also really enjoy going to sporting events. Particularly high school games and local baseball games. I really enjoy the Nebraska State Fair every summer. I really enjoy getting outdoors for some camping and hiking during the summer as well. My nephew is my favorite thing in my life right now. I like spending time with him, my mom, and my sister. I also love to hang out with my friends. I absolutely love to laugh. 

I'm a big fan of most types of comedy and humor but my own personal style leans toward sarcasm. Generally, I'm not very picky about the activities I find myself engaged in as long as I'm in the company of people I like. I have a lot of great memories cuz I have such great friends. I do love to play golf and go to baseball games in the summer. I'm looking to meet someone who shares some of my interests but also has new things to share with me and is willing to learn more about the things that I'm into.
